Never base your solution on assumed values. Always base your solution on the explicitly given variables to ensure correctness. If a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing information, return: **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**.\n    3. **Evaluating Conflicting Solutions**: If different answers are presented during the discussion, choose the most appropriate solution based on your evidence or initiate further discussion to clarify.\n    4. **Final Solution Declaration**: When you are confident about the final solution, return it as follows: **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{_solution_value_here_}**. Ensure that only numerical values are placed inside the \\boxed{}; any accompanying text should be outside.\n\nProblem: $question\n\nHere is the output from Agent Problem Solver:\n$agent_problem_solver\n\nHere is the output from Agent Code Executor:\n$agent_code_executor"
